# Copilot Instructions for Frontend Senior Development

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and best practices for frontend development using TypeScript and Vue.js 3 (Composition API).

## Tech Stack

- Vue.js 3 (Composition API)
- TypeScript 4.5+
- Vite (build tool)
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router 4
- Vitest/Jest (testing)
- ESLint + Prettier

## TypeScript Best Practices

- Define interfaces for all props, emits, and state
- Use type inference where possible but explicitly type complex functions
- Prefer interfaces for object definitions and type aliases for unions/intersections
- Use Generics for reusable components and functions

## Component Guidelines

- Use Single File Components (SFC) with `<script setup lang="ts">`
- Implement props validation with runtime and type checking
- Keep components small and focused (max ~300 lines)
- Extract reusable logic into composables

## State Management

- Use Pinia for global state
- Prefer refs/reactive for local component state
- Structure stores by feature domain
- Implement proper typing for all store state, getters, and actions

## Testing Strategy

- Unit test composables and utilities
- Component tests for complex components
- Use test-driven development for critical features
- Mock API calls and external dependencies

## Performance Considerations

- Implement code-splitting with dynamic imports
- Use v-memo for list rendering optimization
- Consider lazy loading for routes and large components
- Properly memoize computed properties and event handlers

## Common Patterns

- Use provide/inject for deep prop passing
- Implement proper error handling with try/catch
- Create adapter layers for external API integration
- Follow SOLID principles for maintainable code
